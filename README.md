# Game-Site Paired-Programming Project

## Scope
For this project, you and a partner will be building out a game-site based on one of the three games as follows: `Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe or an Image Memory Game`. You will utilize the frontend framework or library you were trained in. One of you will be the `Driver` and the other the `Navigator` to accomplish the feature requirements for your selected game described in [How To Complete This Activity](#how-to-complete-this-activity) section. 

**Note: If you manage to finish one of the games to solid quality, *game functions 100% as intended*, you may work on another game within the given time.**

## Project Setup

- The `Driver` should make a GitHub repository with your partner labeled as `GameSite_<YouAndYourPartnerInitialsHere>` 
    - i.e `GameSite_JGCJ` for Jackie Gomez & Myself.
- The `Driver` should add your partner & myself as a collaborator on the project. My github is `JesterCharles`.
- Create a basic Angular or React application based on what you've been trained on.
- When committing the code make sure to add your `Navigator` as a co-author to each commit, see below example.

    ```bash
    ## Normal commit, but notice the additional lines and addition of Co-authored-by: GitHub-Username <GitHub-Email>" for your navigator
    git commit -m "example of co-authored commit
    >>
    >> Co-authored-by: JesterCharles <JesterCharles@gmail.com>"
    ```

- Images must return to original state if there is no match
- Win State Detection
- Option to reset the game.
- Keep track number of moves
- Match percentages (number of matches / number of moves)


# Deliverables

After the alotted time is completed, you and your partner will showcase everything accomplished with one of the trainers & those who've started with the same game. Expect to answer and ask at least one question about the project. Each group's presentation should be as follows:
 
- No longer than 4 minutes
- Each member must talk
- Expect 1-2 minutes for questions and answers afterwards
