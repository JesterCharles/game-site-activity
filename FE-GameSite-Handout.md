# Game-Site Paired-Programming Project

For this project, you and a partner will be building out a game-site based on one of the three provided games requested by our client. The games are as follows: `Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe & Image Memory Game`. You will utilize the frontend framework or library you were trained in. One of you will be the `Driver` and the other the `Navigator` to accomplish the feature requirements for your selected game described described in [How To Complete This Activity](#how-to-complete-this-activity). 

**Note: If you manage to finish one of the games to solid quality, *game functions 100% as intended*, you may work on another game within the given time.**

## Project Setup

- The `Driver` should make a GitHub repository with your partner labeled as `GameSite_<YouAndYourPartnerInitialsHere>` 
    - i.e `GameSite_JGCJ` for Jackie & me.
- The `Driver` should add your partner & myself as a collaborator on the project. My github is `JesterCharles`.
- Create a basic Angular or React based on what you've been trained on.
- When committing the code make sure to add your `Navigator` as a co-author to each commit, see below example.

    ```bash
    ## Normal commit, but notice the additional lines and addition of Co-authored-by: GitHub-Username <GitHub-Email>" for your navigator
    git commit -m "example of co-authored commit
    >>
    >> Co-authored-by: JesterCharles <JesterCharles@gmail.com>"
    ```

The Tic-Tac-Toe game should allow two players to take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in a 3x3 grid, trying to connect three of their marks in a row. It will contain the following features:

- Keep track of whose turn it is, with 'X' starting first
- Win-Lose-Tie Detection
- option to reset the game.
- Keep score for player 'X' & player 'O'

## Image Memory Game

The Image Memory Game should allow a single player the option to remember the positions of the cards and open two exact images sequentially to score points. Once all cards are flipped to show their image the player is victorious. This should include the follow features:

- If cards don't match, they must return to original state
- Win State Detection
- option to reset the game.
- Keep track number of moves
- Match percentages (number of matches / number of moves)


# Deliverables

After the alotted time is completed, you and your partner will showcase everything accomplished with one of the trainers & those who've started with the same game. Expect to answer at least one question about the project. Each group should take no longer than 5 min to present and both individuals should talk about the project.
